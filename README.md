# Heart-Disease-Prediction

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict the presence of heart disease based on various health parameters.

## 📌 **Dataset**  
- The dataset used is `heart_disease_data.csv`, which contains health-related data points.

## 🚀 **Technologies Used**  
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  

## 📊 **Model Details**  
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression  

## 🧪 **Usage**  
1. Load the dataset  
2. Train the model using Logistic Regression  
3. Predict the output based on user input  

Example:  
```python
input_data = (54,1,2,150,232,0,0,165,0,1.6,2,0,3)
```

## 🎯 **Results**  
- `0` → The person does **NOT** have heart disease  
- `1` → The person **HAS** heart disease
